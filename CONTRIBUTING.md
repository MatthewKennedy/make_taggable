# How to contribute:

## Bug reports / Issues

  * Is something broken or not working as expected? Check for an existing issue or [create a new one](https://github.com/MatthewKennedy/make_taggable/issues/new)
  * IMPORTANT: Include the version of the gem, if you've install from git, what Ruby and Rails you are running, etc.

## Code

1. [Fork and clone the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
2. Install the gem dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Make the changes you want and back them up with tests.
4. Run the tests](https://github.com/MatthewKennedy/make_taggable#testing)
5. Update the CHANGELOG.md file with your changes and give yourself credit
6. Commit and create a pull request with details as to what has been changed and why
  * Use well-described, small (atomic) commits.
  * Include links to any relevant github issues.
  * *Don't* change the VERSION file.

## How I handle pull requests:

* If the tests pass and the pull request looks good, I will merge it.
* If the pull request needs to be changed,
  * you can change it by updating the branch you generated the pull request from
    * either by adding more commits, or
    * by force pushing to it
  * I can make any changes myself and manually merge the code in.

## Documentation

* Update the wiki
